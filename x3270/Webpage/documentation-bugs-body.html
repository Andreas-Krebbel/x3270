<h2>Outstanding Bugs</h2>
<ul>
 <li><b>c3270</b> does not work correctly in UTF-8 locales.
  In particular, characters in the range 0x80..0xff are displayed incorrectly
  (note that these refer to display character codes, not host EBCDIC codes).
  <p>A simple workaround is to ensure that the terminal emulator running
  <b>c3270</b> (<b>xterm</b>, <b>gnome-terminal</b>, etc.) is not using a
  UTF-8 locale.
  For example, you can set the environment variable LANG or LC_CTYPE to
  <tt>en_US.ISO8859-1</tt> before starting the terminal emulator.</p>
  <p>A fix for this is in progress, but will be too large to release as a
  patch.</p>
 <li>'Flipped' mode (for right-to-left languages) is disabled.</li>
 <li>File transfer does not support DBCS.</li>
</ul>
