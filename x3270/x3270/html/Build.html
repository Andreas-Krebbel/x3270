<h1> x3270 Build and Install Instructions</h1>
    
<h2> Where Things Get Installed</h2>
  By default, parts of x3270 are installed under two different directories.
 
<p>Files which are specific to X11 (the x3270 binary, x3270
 manual pages, and fonts) are installed in the system X11 directory (typically
 <tt>/usr/X11R6</tt> or <tt>/usr/openwin</tt>). This directory is defined 
when your system is installed and cannot be easily changed. This is referred 
to as <i>xdir</i> in the table below. </p>
 
<p>Files which are shared with other non-X11 3270 applications (the <i>x3270if</i>
 binary and man pages, and the configuration files) are 
installed in the autoconf prefix directory, typically <tt>/usr/local</tt>.
The autoconf prefix directory can be changed with options to the x3270
<tt>configure</tt>
 script. This is referred to as <i>prefix</i> in the table below. <br>
 &nbsp;  
<table border="1" cols="2" width="100%">
  <tbody>
     <tr>
  <td><b>Files</b></td>
   <td><b>Installed In</b></td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
  <td>Binary for x3270</td>
  <td><tt><i>xdir</i>/bin</tt></td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
  <td>Manual pages for x3270</td>
  <td><tt><i>xdir</i>/man</tt></td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
  <td>Fonts</td>
  <td><tt><i>xdir</i>/fonts/misc</tt></td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
  <td>Binaries for <i>x3270if</i></td>
  <td><tt><i>prefix</i>/bin</tt></td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
  <td>Manual page for <i>x3720if</i></td>
  <td><tt><i>prefix</i>/man</tt></td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
  <td>Configuration files (<tt>ibm_hosts</tt>, character set definitions)
used by x3270 and other programs</td>
   <td><tt><i>prefix</i>/etc</tt></td>
  </tr>
     
  </tbody> 
</table>
   </p>
 
<p>If you want everything installed in your system X11 directory, use the
 following <tt>configure</tt> command: </p>
 
<blockquote>    
  <pre><tt>configure --with-all-xinstall</tt></pre>
  </blockquote>
  By contrast, if you want everyting to be installed in the autoconf prefix
 directory, use the default <tt>configure</tt> command, but use a different
 <tt>make</tt> target:  
<blockquote>    
  <pre><tt>make install.byprefix</tt></pre>
  </blockquote>
    
<h2> Vanilla X11R6 or X11R5</h2>
  x3270 is set up to build and install without modifications under
any complete X11R6 or X11R5 implementation.  
<p>A "complete" R6 or R5 implementation means that <i>xmkmf</i> and <i>imake</i>
 are configured and installed on your system, and that the <tt>Xaw</tt> and 
<tt>Xmu</tt> libraries and header files are installed. Some vendors (HP, IBM,
SCO) consider these optional software and do not always install them.  </p>
 
<p>If you are running vanilla X11R6 or X11R5, then the build procedure is 
to ensure that your X11 <tt>bin</tt> directory is in your <tt>$PATH</tt>,
 then: </p>
 
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ./configure&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # probe for system dependencies and create the Makefile<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make depend&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # add dependency information<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # build x3270 and its fonts</pre>
  x3270 prefers that its fonts be installed in order to run. However,
 a script is provided for testing a local copy of x3270 in the current
 directory:  
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ./dryrun&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # test x3270</pre>
  Once you are satisfied that x3270 is working, you can install it
(as root) with the command:  
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make install<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make install.man</pre>
  Before running x3270, you will also need to (once):  
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xset fp rehash</pre>
  That's the easy way. Here are the exceptions:  
<h2> IBM AIX</h2>
  AIX X11R5 does not include <i>xmkmf</i> or <i>imake</i>,
 but it includes the source code for them. If these have not been built and 
installed on your system (<i>e.g.</i>, if there is no such file as <tt>/usr/bin/X11/imake</tt>),
 you must first build and install them by following the instructions in <tt>/usr/lpp/X11/Xamples/README</tt>.
 
<p>Once these have been installed, you can use the standard X11R5 build procedure 
above. </p>
<p>The default installation of AIX may also not include the <i>bdftopcf</i> 
utility, which may need to be installed separately as part of the
<b>X11.fnt.util</b> package.</p>
 
<h2> HP-UX A9.01, X11R5</h2>
  HP's X11R5 distribution does not include the <tt>Xaw</tt> libraries or
header files. As HP's X man page says,  
<blockquote>A number of unsupported core MIT clients and miscellaneous utilities 
are provided in /usr/contrib/bin. In addition, the entire core MIT distribution, 
compiled for Hewlett-Packard platforms, can be obtained from HP's users group 
INTERWORKS for a nominal fee. See the release notes for details.</blockquote>
  What you need is the <tt>Xaw</tt> and <tt>Xmu</tt> libraries, <i>imake</i>,
 and <i>xmkmf</i>. Then you can follow the vanilla R5 build and install instructions.
 
<h2> Sun Solaris 2.x</h2>
  Follow the instructions for Vanilla X11R6, with the following changes.
 
<h3> Using Sun's Unbundled C Compiler</h3>
  <b>Do not use</b> Sun's "BSD-compatibility" C compiler, <tt>/usr/ucb/cc</tt>.
 This is good advice in general, and in particular, x3270 will not
build under it. To build x3270 with Sun's unbundled C compiler, you
should have <tt>/opt/SUNWspro/SC<i>x.x</i>/bin</tt> (replacing <i>x.x</i>
with the actual version of the compiler) in your $PATH, before <tt>/usr/ucb</tt>.
 
<p>You might also want to take advantage of the Sun compiler's optimization
 features.&nbsp; This can be done with the command line: </p>
 
<blockquote>    
  <pre>make CDEBUGFLAGS=-x02</pre>
  </blockquote>
    
<h3> Using gcc</h3>
  Sun's <i>xmkmf</i> configuration puts some compiler flags in the <tt>Makefile</tt>
 that are specific to Sun's unbundled C compiler, and you will get a number
 of harmless, but annoying error messages when compiling with <i>gcc</i>.
To eliminate these, use the command:  
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make CDEBUGFLAGS=-O CCOPTIONS="-DSYSV -DSVR4"</pre>
    
<h3> Running x3270</h3>
  To run x3270, your <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt> environment variable
must include <tt>/usr/openwin/lib</tt>.  
<h2> Mixed X Environments</h2>
  If you are running a mixture of X environments, such as running a Sun XNews
 server but using X11R6 libraries and header files, the supplied <tt>Imakefile</tt>
 may not work properly, because it assumes that your server and libraries
are of the same type. This is not an impossible situation, just a difficult
one. It generally means that you will have to build and install the fonts
separately, perhaps even by hand.  
<h2> Building Fonts for X Terminals</h2>
  The Imakefile that comes with x3270 assumes that you plan to run the x3270
 client on the same workstation as your X server. Therefore it builds fonts
 for that kind of X server. Compiled fonts (.snf or .pcf files) are not compatible 
between different servers, so if you run x3270 with its display somewhere 
else (such as on an X Terminal), you will need to compile the fonts for that 
server. It is impossible to give comprehensive instructions here; however, 
here is an outline for how to do it:  
<ul>
 Copy all of the <tt>.bdf</tt> files from the x3270 distribution into 
a new directory, say <tt>XXX</tt>.    
  <p><i>cd</i> into <tt>XXX</tt>. </p>
   
  <p>For each <tt>.bdf</tt> file, run the server-specific version of <i>bdftosnf</i>
 or <i>bdftopcf</i> to create a <tt>.snf</tt> or <tt>.pcf</tt> file. For
example, for to build an NCD font on a Sun-4, the command is: </p>
   
  <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /usr/local/NCD/binSun4/bdftosnf 3270.bdf &gt;3270.snf</pre>
  Run the server-specific version of <i>mkfontdir</i>. For example:    
  <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /usr/local/NCD/binSun4/mkfontdir .</pre>
  Then tell your X server to use this directory:    
  <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xset fp+ XXX<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xset fp rehash</pre>
   
</ul>
    
<h2> SCO Open Desktop 3</h2>
  x3270 requires the Athena Widgets library, which is available from
 sosco.sco.com.  
<h2>Building on FreeBSD</h2>
FreeBSD's <b>iconv</b> library is installed in <tt>/usr/local</tt>, so
the the following options must be passed to the <tt>configure</tt> script:
  <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;./configure LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include</pre>
<h2> Using an app-defaults File</h2>
  Earlier versions of x3270 required a separate <b>app-defaults</b>
 file. The app-defaults file contains definitions for options, text strings,
 fonts, colors, etc. The file allows x3270 to be reconfigured without
 recompiling by simply editing the file.  
<p>Unfortunately, using an app-defaults file is a pain. The mechanism for
 finding the file is so flexible as to be almost incomprehensible, and it
is difficult to run the program without doing a full installation, requiring
 root access to your system. Also, the app-defaults file generally changes
 whenever the program changes, and making sure that x3270 finds the
 <b>correct</b> app-defaults file compounds the above problems. </p>
 
<p>Starting with version 3.1.0.0, x3270 no longer uses a separate
app-defaults file. Instead, the file is compiled into x3270 itself.
If however, you prefer to have a separate app-defaults file, you can compile
x3270  to use it. </p>
 
<p>First, you must decide whether you want app-defaults for a color display
 or a monochrome display. For a color display, the commands are: </p>
 
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ./configure --enable-app-defaults<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make clean<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make</pre>
  For a monochrome display, the commands are:  
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ./configure --enable-app-defaults=-UCOLOR<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make clean<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make</pre>
    
<h2> Summary of <tt>configure</tt> Options</h2>
