<h1>Caveats and Known Issues for x3270, c3270, wc3270, s3270, ws3270, tcl3270, pr3287 and wpr3287 4.0</h1>

<h2>Linux</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Unity's Terminal app will intercept a number of keys (such as F1) that
  c3270 needs for 3270 operations. The easiest way to prevent this is to create
  a profile for c3270, with Shortcuts disabled (from the taskbar, select
  Preferences from the Terminal menu, then go to the Shortcuts tab and un-check
  <i>Enable shortcuts</i>). You can also disable or remap individual shortcuts
  if you find the others useful.</li>
</ul>

<h2>MacOS</h2>
<ul>
 <li>When running c3270 in a Terminal window, the Backspace key performs the
  <b>Delete()</b> action (deleting the character under the cursor) instead of
  the <b>BackSpace()</b> action (deleting the character to the left of the
  cursor). This is corrected through Terminal's Preferences dialog. Under the
  Advanced tab, select <i>Delete sends Control-H</i>.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Changes in x3270, c3270, wc3270, s3270, ws3270, tcl3270, pr3287 and wpr3287 4.0</h1>
4.0 is the current development line for the x3270 suite.
<h2>Changes in version 4.0alpha1 nn. Month 2018</h2>
<ul>
 <li>A new <b>b3270</b> emulator has been added, intended as a common
  back-end for user interfaces written in any language or framework.</li>
 <li>The action-processing framework is now asynchronous. Actions run
  independently, unless there is an explicit reason for one to wait for
  another.</li>
 <li>c3270 and wc3270 will continue to respond to host messages while the
  prompt or a print dialog is displayed.</li>
 <li>Removed the NVT-mode restriction that a received character must be
  defined in the host code page (character set) in order for the emulator to
  display it.</li>
 <li>The number of situations in x3270 and c3270/wc3270 where a
  delay is inserted after the host unlocks the keyboard has been reduced.
  Now this happens only
  when multiple actions are specified on one command line, when actions are
  being read from a file with <b>Source()</b> and there are more actions
  specified in the file, and when a <b>String()</b> argument contains embedded
  AID specifiers such as <b>\n</b>, <b>\pa</b> or <b>\pf</b> and more text
  follows.</li>
 <li>The old x3270 <i>Execute an action</i> menu option is now <i>x3270&gt;
  Prompt</i>, which brings up an interactive window. In addition, a new
  <b>Prompt()</b> action starts a new interactive prompt window in any
  emulator.</li>
 <li>A number of parameters that can be changed at run-time, instead of just
  at initialization, using an extended <b>Toggle()</b> action or the new
  <b>Set()</b> action. <b>Set()</b> and <b>Toggle()</b> are nearly identical;
  both can be used to set an explicit value, but only <b>Toggle()</b> can be
  used to implicitly flip a Boolean parameter.</li>
 <li>Without an argument, <b>Set()</b> and <b>Toggle()</b> report the values
  of all run-time alterable parameters.</li>
 <li>A new <b>ReadBuffer(Field)</b> mode displays the
  contents of the current field.</li>
 <li>A new <b>ReadBuffer(Unicode)</b> mode displays the
  buffer contents as Unicode (U+nnnn) values.</li>
 <li>New actions that use 1-origin coordinates were added:
  <b>MoveCursor1()</b>, <b>Ascii1()</b> and <b>Ebcdic1()</b>.</li>
 <li><b>MoveCursor()</b> and <b>MoveCursor1()</b> now accept a single
  parameter, a screen offset, in addition to the usual row and column
  coordinates.</b>
 <li>A new <b>Actions()</b> action lists all available actions.</li>
 <li>A new <b>Tasks()</b> action displays currently active tasks (pending
  actions and listeners).</li>
 <li>Scripts and files read by <b>Source()</b> now implicitly lock the keyboard
  while they are running. A new <b>KeyboardDisable()</b> action can be used
  to explicitly lock or unlock the keyboad using the arguments <b>True</b>
  and <b>False</b>. To force the keyboard to be unlocked, use the
  <b>ForceEnable</b> keyword.</li>
 <li>The <b>Script()</b> action takes several new arguments. <b>-Async</b>
  causes the script to run asynchronously -- the emulator does not wait for it
  to complete. <b>-NoLock</b> turns off automatic keyboad locking.
  <b>-Single</b> causes (on Windows) just a single TCP connection to be
  accepted from the child process.</li>
 <li>The <b>c3270</b> <b>Escape()</b> action now accepts a paramter,
  the name and arguments of an action to run at the console prompt.</li>
 <li>A new <b>TemporaryComposeMap()</b> action allows a temporary compose map
  to be installed and removed. It is used by x3270 APL mode.</li>
  <li>APL keyboard operation on x3270 has changed. There is no longer a fixed
  APL keymap. Instead, the key combination Shift-Escape toggles APL mode, which
  includes a temporary keyboard map, a temporary compose map, and changes in
  how cut and paste operations are handled (preferring the APL mappings for
  Unicode characters that have both APL and non-APL mappings). The separate APL
  character set has been removed; APL text can be displayed using any host
  code page (character set).
 <li>The binary <b>s3270.exe</b> is now installed, and is identical to
  <b>ws3270.exe</b>.</li>
 <li>A new <b>T:</b> host prefix turns off the TELNET protocol.</li>
 <li>Switched from Visual Studio 2013 to Visual Studio 2017.</li>
 <li>The <b>tls</b> resource has been renamed to <b>startTls</b>.</li>
 <li>Tcl3270 has been rewritten to use s3270 as a back-end, so it runs
  without blocking. Its command-line syntax has been corrected to be consistent
  with tclsh(1).</li>
 <li>Parameters to the <b>Transfer()</b> action are no longer required to use
  <i>keyword</i>=<i>value</i> syntax. Option values can just follow the keyword
  sequentially, so <b>"HostFile=xxx text a"</b> can be given as
  <b>HostFile,"xxx text a"</b>.
 <li>The c3270 prompt is now in color.</li>
 <li>The HTTP and SOCKS proxies can now accept a username and password,
  delimited by an <b>@</b> character. E.g.,
  <b>-proxy http:myuser:mypass@proxyhost:8080</b>.</li>
 <li>A large number of bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
